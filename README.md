# About the Project
The project aims to develop a real-time analysis system using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark with cloud-based architecture. The system will collect real-time data and stream the data into Kafka. Apache Spark will then be used to process and analyze the data in real-time. The processed data will be visualized using appropriate visualizations and graphs.

The system will have two main components:

* **Data Collection:** This component will collect real-time data from various sources such as IOT, SCADA, CCTV, Stock Indexes, Weather Data ...etc. The data will be cleaned and transformed into a structured format before streaming it into Kafka.

* **Data Processing and Visualization:** This component will process the real-time data streams using Apache Spark. Spark will perform various real-time analysis tasks such as trend analysis, stock prediction, and outlier detection. The processed data will then be visualized using interactive dashboards and graphs to provide real-time insights into the stock market trends.

The system will be scalable, allowing it to handle a large volume of data streams and perform real-time analysis.

The project will be implemented using a combination of technologies such as **Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, AWS , Jupyter Notebook, and a front-end visualization tool such as AWS QuickSight**. The implementation will be based on a cloud-based architecture, ensuring high availability and scalability of the system.

## What is cloud computing?
cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Why AWS?
AWS is recognized as the world's most comprehensive, widely adopted cloud platform, offering 200+ featured services from data centers globally. In today's world, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, agile, low-cost infrastructure platform in the Cloud for the countless businesses running in over 190 countries.
